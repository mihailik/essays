Are Big Movie Stars Paid Too Much?
==================================

Movie stars are paid outrageous money. Why?

Because stars like Jonny Depp can ask a very steep price for their services. And when they do, film companies need Jonny Depp for their movies badly enough to cough up. They won't just pick another eager talented actor from the street and pay her half the money. They can't. Why?

Because the audience is more excited about Jonny Depp than an unknown new face. *(Whenever the Doctor regenerates, he faces a big struggle to fill the shoes of his predecessor. Familiar personality helps the narrative. - find the more epic wording before putting this piece) Why?

Well, it's not just the movie audience, the same rule applies to books and any stories. The innate laws of a good narrative favour bold strokes: fewer names, but stronger characters, more epic stories. We don't want to learn how innumerate deeds of thousands of soldiers summarily won the battle, we want to hear about the glorious leader single-handedly slaying the serpent. Failing that, even a humble servant would do, as long as it's not a whole lot of them.

And isn't that the same reason good movies tend to come with sequels?
