Are Big Movie Stars Paid Too Much?
==================================

Movie stars are paid outrageous money. Why?

Because stars like Jonny Depp can ask a very steep price for their services. And when they do, film companies need Jonny Depp for their movies badly enough to cough up. They won't just pick another eager talented actor from the street and pay her half the money. They can't. Why?

Because the audience is more excited about Jonny Depp than an unknown new face. *(Whenever the Doctor regenerates, he faces a big struggle to fill the shoes of his predecessor. Familiar personality helps the narrative. - find the more epic wording before putting this piece)* Why?

Well, it's not just the movie audience, the same rule applies to books and any stories. The innate laws of a good narrative favour bold strokes: fewer names, but stronger characters, more epic stories. We don't want to learn how innumerate deeds of thousands of soldiers summarily won the battle, we want to hear about the glorious leader single-handedly slaying the serpent. Failing that, even a humble servant would do, as long as it's not a whole lot of them.

And isn't that the same reason good movies tend to come with sequels? Not because film companies want to make more money from the same material, as the more cynical of us like to speculate. No, we **want** sequels, we, the audience -- and our collective wish make it happen.

Having famous actor play in the next movie sells. Having famous actor play the same role sells even better. Just recall Star Wars episodes X to Y. Familiar faces, familiar themes, familiar environment -- all that creates warm pleasant feeling. Why?

Love. Nobody knows how exactly it happens, but once in a whil you meet a person, a place, a book, an idea -- and you fall in love. It's not the familiarity that's enticing and endearing in a person, place, book or idea, for there are many a familiar horrid *(synonym?)* places and ideas. It's love, an invisible bond.

We fall in love with actors, and
